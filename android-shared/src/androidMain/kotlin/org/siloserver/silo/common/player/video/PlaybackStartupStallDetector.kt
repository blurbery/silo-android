/**
 * Detects a playback session wedged in BUFFERING with no forward progress —
 * both at STARTUP ("Media3 accepted this but playback never started") and
 * MID-STREAM ("it was playing, then froze forever"). Preflight covers known
 * unsupported tracks and player errors; this covers the silent buffer-forever
 * case that never surfaces an error. Applies to ALL routes (direct, remux,
 * transcode, HLS) — a wedged compatibility-route remux used to have no watchdog
 * at all (TV QA 2026-07-10: some remuxes buffer indefinitely).
