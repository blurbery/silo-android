 *
 * Lives in commonMain so the shared ViewModel can depend on it; the Room-backed
 * implementation is Android-only and bound in the platform DI module. The
 * default no-op keeps commonMain/tests network-only.
 *
 * Cache is keyed by the active `(serverId, profileId)` inside the impl, and only
 * written for a *fully resolved* fetch — a partial refresh must not overwrite a
 * good cached home.
