 * as a snap, especially between tall row items where the travel distance
 * is large. tvOS paces its detail focus scrolls with
 * `easeInOut(duration: 0.45)` (`TVDetailFocusScroll.swift`) — the symmetric
 * ease-in matters more than the duration: `FastOutSlowIn` launches at full
 * velocity on frame one and reads as a snap on long hero→rail jumps, while
 * ease-in-out accelerates gently from rest. Slightly longer than Apple's
 * 450ms since this spec also covers the longest travel distances. The
 * scroll distance keeps a modest viewport gutter around focused content so
 * TV rows do not settle half clipped against the screen edge.

/**
 * Horizontal rail scroll behaviour, shared by every card carousel.
 *
 * The focused card is PINNED: its leading edge slides to the row's start
 * padding — the tvOS / Netflix rail model — so every Right or Left is one
 * uniform card-sized glide and the focused card always sits in the same place
 * on screen. Row ends still clamp naturally.
 *
 * Two pieces, deliberately split:
 *
 * - [Modifier.tvRailPinOnFocus] performs the pin as a ONE-SHOT clamped
 *   `animateScrollBy` when a card gains focus (mirroring the detail page's
 *   section anchors). It is the ONLY horizontal scroll a focus change
 *   triggers, and it starts on the focus frame itself, so the highlight and
 *   the glide begin together and read as one motion.
 * - [TvRailScrollBehavior] tells the LazyRow's automatic bring-into-view to
 *   stay out of it horizontally (distance 0 — the request is satisfied at
 *   once, nothing loops). Before this, the auto request started a "minimal
 *   reveal" animation on the focus frame and the pin cancelled and restarted
 *   it a frame later from zero velocity: the highlight visibly landed on the
 *   right, paused, then the row re-launched leftward — the "jumpy" rail.
 *   Vertical requests keep bubbling to the enclosing column's own spec.
 *
 * The pin must NOT be expressed as the BringIntoViewSpec's scroll distance:
 * Compose keeps re-launching the bring-into-view animation on every layout
 * pass while the spec still reports a non-zero distance, and a pinned position
 * is unreachable whenever the row is clamped at either end — so during any
 * concurrent animation (a vertical row scroll re-lays the rail out each frame)
 * it spun a new scroll job per frame. Measured on the Shield as p90 121ms and
 * near-frozen vertical navigation.
 *
 * Shared 100 ms card steps, tuned on the Shield. Horizontal repeats wait
 * for the current step to settle so focus never outruns the visible cards.
