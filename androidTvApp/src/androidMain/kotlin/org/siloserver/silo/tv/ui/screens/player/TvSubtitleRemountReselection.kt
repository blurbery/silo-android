 * ordinal pipeline that raced it is gone — but the adapter still serves three
 * kinds of intent, and a weaker one arriving late must not evict a stronger one
 * that is still being applied. That collision is what used to turn an applied
 * subtitle back off: a rollback armed the pre-transaction identity (typically
 * Off) over the selection the viewer had just made.
 *
 * Higher ordinal wins.
